# Dungeon Quest: Web-Based Dungeon Crawler
## Design Document

---

## 1. Game Overview

**Dungeon Quest** is a browser-based dungeon crawler that combines classic roguelike elements with modern web technologies. The game features grid-based movement, procedurally generated dungeons, and turn-based combat, all implemented using vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript without any external libraries or frameworks.

### Core Concept
Players navigate through a series of procedurally generated dungeon floors, battling monsters, collecting loot, and upgrading their character with the ultimate goal of defeating a final boss and escaping the dungeon.

### Target Audience
- Casual gamers looking for short, engaging play sessions
- Fans of traditional roguelike and dungeon crawler games
- Players who enjoy strategic turn-based combat
- Web users seeking games that work across multiple devices without installation

### Data Storage
- Local storage API for saving game progress
- JSON structures for game state, inventory, and character stats

### Browser Compatibility
- Target: Modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Fallback mechanisms for older browsers where possible
- Responsive design for desktop and mobile play

---

## 3. Game Mechanics

### Movement and Exploration
- Grid-based movement system (cardinal directions)
- Turn-based gameplay where each action advances the game state
- Fog of war with progressive dungeon reveal as the player explores
- Limited visibility radius affected by lighting conditions and items

### Procedural Generation
- Dungeon layouts generated using a modified Binary Space Partitioning (BSP) algorithm
- Room templates with variations for different dungeon themes (crypt, cave, ruins, etc.)
- Difficulty scaling based on dungeon depth
- Guaranteed path to exit with optional exploration for rewards

### Resource Management
- Health points (HP): Depleted in combat, restored with items or rest
- Energy points (EP): Consumed when using special abilities
- Inventory space: Limited by character strength and equipment
- Light sources: Torches and lanterns with limited duration

---

## 4. Combat System

### Core Mechanics
- Simplified combat system with direct damage dealing
- Armor reduces incoming damage (e.g., 6 armor blocks 6 damage)
- Positioning matters (flanking, ranged attacks)
- Critical hits and misses based on character stats and RNG

### Enemies
- Diverse enemy types with unique behaviors:
  - Melee attackers (close combat)
  - Ranged attackers (attack from distance)
  - Spellcasters (area effects and debuffs)
  - Swarmers (weak but numerous)
  - Elite monsters (stronger variants with special abilities)
  - Bosses (unique mechanics for each floor boss)

### Combat Flow
1. Initiative determination based on agility stats
2. Action selection (attack, use item, special ability, move, flee)
3. Resolution of actions with visual and audio feedback
4. Enemy AI decision and action
5. Repeat until combat ends

---

## 5. Character System

### Classes
- **Warrior**: High HP, strong melee attacks, limited ranged options
- **Rogue**: High agility, critical hit focus, trap detection
- **Mage**: Low HP, powerful spells, vulnerable in close combat
- **Cleric**: Balanced stats, healing abilities, undead specialization

### Attributes
- **Strength**: Affects physical damage and carrying capacity
- **Agility**: Affects initiative, dodge chance, and critical hit rate
- **Intelligence**: Affects spell power and puzzle-solving bonuses
- **Constitution**: Affects max HP and resistance to effects

### Progression
- Experience points (XP) gained from combat and exploration
- Level-ups grant attribute points and new abilities
- Equipment slots (weapon, armor, helmet, accessory, etc.) with unique bonuses
- Simplified skill trees with meaningful choices

## 6. User Interface Design

### Game Screen Layout
- Main viewport showing the dungeon grid (60-70% of screen)
- Character status panel (HP, EP, level, effects)
- Minimap showing explored areas (togglable)
- Action bar with common commands
- Message log for game events and combat results

### Input Methods
- Keyboard controls (arrow keys, WASD, number keys for actions)
- Mouse/touch controls for movement and action selection
- Context-sensitive actions for interacting with objects and entities

### Menus
- Inventory management with drag-and-drop functionality
- Character sheet showing stats and equipped items
- Settings menu for audio and visual preferences
- Help screen with gameplay instructions

### Visual Feedback
- Animation for attacks, spells, and movement
- Color-coding for damage types and effects
- Screen shake for impactful events
- Highlighting for interactive elements

---

## 7. Art Style

### Visual Direction
- Pixel art style with modern touches
- Limited color palette for each dungeon theme
- Clean, readable UI elements
- Consistent iconography for items and abilities

### Dungeon Environments
- Distinct visual themes for different dungeon types
- Environmental details that hint at dungeon lore
- Animated elements (torches, water, etc.)
- Lighting effects (shadows, fog, glow)

### Character Representation
- Distinct silhouettes for different character classes and enemy types
- Equipment visually reflected on character sprites
- Animation states for idle, movement, attack, and defeat
- Status effects visually indicated on character models

---

## 8. Progression and Balance

### Difficulty Curve
- Gradual introduction of game mechanics
- Progressive scaling of enemy difficulty
- Strategic placement of resources and safe zones
- Risk vs. reward decisions for optional exploration

### Replayability Elements
- Randomized dungeon layouts
- Varied enemy placement and behavior
- Random loot drops with rarity tiers
- Daily challenges with fixed RNG seeds

### Economy
- Gold and treasure for purchasing items
- Crafting materials from monsters and environment
- Merchants at certain dungeon levels
- Item identification and enchantment systems

---

## 9. Technical Implementation Details

### Rendering Approach
- HTML table or CSS grid for dungeon layout
- CSS classes for visual states and animations
- DOM manipulation for updating game state
- Canvas elements for specific visual effects

### Performance Considerations
- Efficient DOM updates with document fragments
- Throttled event listeners for input handling
- Lazy loading of assets for deeper dungeon levels
- Memory management for extended play sessions

### Save System
- Automatic saving after significant events
- Manual save option at rest areas
- Multiple save slots for different characters
- Export/import save data functionality
